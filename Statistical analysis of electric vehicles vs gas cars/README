# Statistical Analysis of Electric Vehicles

## Overview

This project analyzes the dataset "EVs - One Electric Vehicle Dataset - Smaller" from Kaggle. The goal is to determine if Tesla cars are significantly faster than other electric vehicles (EVs) regarding top speed and acceleration.

## Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no significant difference in the top speed and acceleration of Tesla electric vehicles compared to other manufacturers.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Tesla electric vehicles have a higher top speed or faster acceleration than other manufacturers.

## Results

The null hypothesis was rejected, indicating that Tesla electric vehicles have significantly higher top speeds or faster acceleration than other manufacturers.
Reject the null hypothesis for top speed
Reject the null hypothesis for acceleration
T statistics for the top speed hypothesis: 6.248005320456953 p-values for the top speed hypothesis: 1.022737777876629e-08
T statistics for the acceleration hypothesis: -4.261290437403599 p-value for the acceleration hypothesis: 4.6061132267831526e-05

A linear regression model was built to predict a car price based on characteristics. Model's R-squared value 0.90, F-statistic:	7.842

## Data Source

- [Kaggle Dataset: EVs - One Electric Vehicle Dataset - Smaller](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geoffnel/evs-one-electric-vehicle-dataset)

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:** The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and outliers, remove irrelevant columns
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Basic statistics were computed using visualization and analytics to understand the data distribution.
3. **Hypothesis Testing:** Statistical tests were performed to compare Tesla's performance with other manufacturers.
4. **Modelin**. A linear regression model was built based on car characteristics to predict the price.

## Conclusion

The analysis shows that Tesla vehicles are significantly faster in either top speed or acceleration than other electric vehicles in the dataset.
