# -Projects
This repository contains the project I worked on to demonstrate various programming and data analysis skills.
Each folder has a corresponding file to separate projects.
Please read the README files for more information.


Projects list 

1)	COVID-19 analysis – effect of vaccination on death rates.
This project is focused on conducting a statistical analysis of the effect of vaccination against COVID-19 on the population during the recent pandemic. The aim was to see if there was a significant effect on number of deaths pre- and post-vaccination.

2)	Statistical analysis of electric vehicles vs gas cars.
This project aims to provide a statistical measure of the efficiency differences between electric cars and regular gas cars.  The model is built on car characteristics like fuel consumption, power, base, etc. Also, I attempted to build a machine learning model to predict car price based on its characteristics.

3)	Data Scientists' Salary predictions using regression models. 
This project is focused on developing a regression model for salary prediction of data science-related jobs. For this task, I used Random Forest and XGboost regression algorithms.


4)	Predictive analytics project. Data Scientist salary surveys from Kaggle.
This is a continuation of the previous project. This time a survey from Kaggle.com on salary of Data Scientists was used. The aim is to find an important feature that affects the salary and provide recommendations.  Also, I attempted to develop a predictive model for data scientist salary using this survey data.

5)	Data Wrangling projects: Flat file, Web Scraping, API resources.
This project is a combination of three smaller projects. The focus is to demonstrate data wrangling skills using different resources for data scraping. The projects use Python language and libraries to obtain, clean, and transform data.

6)	Data Visualization: Dashboard, Infographic, Blog Post.
This project combines a few small projects focused on design and visualizations. I utilized design and dashboard-building tools to show data visualization skills. I used a case of sales improvement for Southwest Airlines by providing information on air traveling safety and communicating it publically.

7)	Big Data Project.
This is a placeholder for DSC650 final project. Once the topic is defined, I will add a description.

8)	Breast cancer detection Part I:  Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set – classification models 
This project aimed to classify a cell as cancerous or non-cancerous by utilizing different algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost algorithms. The data used for this project is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set. 

9)	Breast cancer detection Part II: Breast Scan analysis using Neural Networks.
For this project, I plan to continue working on breast cancer detection. The goal is to develop a neural network model that will use breast scans to classify for cancer detection. This project is a continuation of the previous project and can improve the classification accuracy when combined with the XGBoost classification model.

10)	LLM.
Have not identified what exactly I will do for this project, but I want to do a project on LLM.
